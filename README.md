# PCA-Engine
A framework for building Point-and-Click Adventure games in the web browser.

**Current Status:** Proof of Concept

## Installation
- `npm install`
- `npm run-script` compiles `.scss` files
- `npm start` starts the server at `localhost:3000`

## History
PCA-Engine originally started as an exploration of htmx. In the past I've made different Text Adventure games, and it felt like a natural progression to move to graphical Point-and-Click as my next iteration.
