# PCA-Engine
A framework for building Point-and-Click Adventure games in the web browser.

Uses NodeJS & Express as the back-end, and HTMX & Vanilla JS on the front-end.

**Current Status:** Proof of Concept

## Installation
- `npm install`
- `npm run-script css` compiles `.scss` files
- `npm start` starts the server at `localhost:3000`

## History
PCA-Engine originally started as an exploration of [htmx](https://htmx.org/). In the past I've made different Text Adventure games, and it felt like a natural progression to move to graphical Point-and-Click as my next iteration.
